```{r setup-1, include=FALSE}
#rm(list = ls()) # clear memory, step 1
#gc() # clear memory, step 2
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
# load the necessary packages ("extensions")
library(tidyverse)
```

## Setting up data and environment

We first need to do a few things before we can manipulate the data. 
```{r setup-2}
# set path for R to find our data
#data_path <- "~/Dropbox/McGill/teaching/2021-2022/2022_summer/ORGB672/data/"
```


## 1. Load data

We'll load application data only here (you are welcome to load the other three files as well). Because we are loading from a .parquet format file, we'll use library `arrow` and the functions `read_parquet()`. For the rest of the files, we can use function `read_csv()` which comes with a package `readr` (which is included in `tidyverse` set of packages, so if we are loading `tidyverse` there is no need to also load `readr`). Note that the path to the data file on my computer is defined above, in the `data_path` variable.

```{r load-data}
library(arrow) # to be able to load data in the .parquet format
# read application data
app_data_sample <- read_parquet("app_data_sample.parquet")

```

To inspect the top slice of the data, we can simply call it:

```{r show-data}
#app_data_sample
```
### Get gender for examiners

We'll get gender based on the first name of the examiner, which is recorded in the field `examiner_name_first`. We'll use library `gender` for that, relying on a modified version of their own [example](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gender/vignettes/predicting-gender.html).

Note that there are over 2 million records in the applications table -- that's because there are many records for each examiner, as many as the number of applications that examiner worked on during this time frame. Our first step therefore is to get all *unique* names in a separate list `examiner_names`. We will then guess gender for each one and will join this table back to the original dataset. So, let's get names without repetition:

```{r gender-1}
library(gender)
#install_genderdata_package() # only run this line the first time you use the package, to get data for it
# get a list of first names without repetitions
examiner_names <- app_data_sample %>% 
  distinct(examiner_name_first)
examiner_names
```

Now let's use function `gender()` as shown in the example for the package to attach a gender and probability to each name and put the results into the table `examiner_names_gender`

```{r gender-2}
# get a table of names and gender
examiner_names_gender <- examiner_names %>% 
  do(results = gender(.$examiner_name_first, method = "ssa")) %>% 
  unnest(cols = c(results), keep_empty = TRUE) %>% 
  select(
    examiner_name_first = name,
    gender,
    proportion_female
  )
examiner_names_gender
```

Finally, let's join that table back to our original applications data and discard the temporary tables we have just created to reduce clutter in our environment.

```{r gender-3}
# remove extra colums from the gender table
examiner_names_gender <- examiner_names_gender %>% 
  select(examiner_name_first, gender)
# joining gender back to the dataset
app_data_sample <- app_data_sample %>% 
  left_join(examiner_names_gender, by = "examiner_name_first")
# cleaning up
rm(examiner_names)
rm(examiner_names_gender)
gc()
```


### Guess the examiner's race

We'll now use package `wru` to estimate likely race of an examiner. Just like with gender, we'll get a list of unique names first, only now we are using surnames.

```{r race-1}
library(wru)
examiner_surnames <- app_data_sample %>% 
  select(surname = examiner_name_last) %>% 
  distinct()
examiner_surnames
```
We'll follow the instructions for the package outlined here [https://github.com/kosukeimai/wru](https://github.com/kosukeimai/wru).

```{r race-2}
examiner_race <- predict_race(voter.file = examiner_surnames, surname.only = T) %>% 
  as_tibble()
examiner_race
```

As you can see, we get probabilities across five broad US Census categories: white, black, Hispanic, Asian and other. (Some of you may correctly point out that Hispanic is not a race category in the US Census, but these are the limitations of this package.)

Our final step here is to pick the race category that has the highest probability for each last name and then join the table back to the main applications table. See this example for comparing values across columns: [https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2020/04/dplyr-1-0-0-rowwise/](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2020/04/dplyr-1-0-0-rowwise/). And this one for `case_when()` function: [https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/case_when.html](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/case_when.html).

```{r race-3}
examiner_race <- examiner_race %>% 
  mutate(max_race_p = pmax(pred.asi, pred.bla, pred.his, pred.oth, pred.whi)) %>% 
  mutate(race = case_when(
    max_race_p == pred.asi ~ "Asian",
    max_race_p == pred.bla ~ "black",
    max_race_p == pred.his ~ "Hispanic",
    max_race_p == pred.oth ~ "other",
    max_race_p == pred.whi ~ "white",
    TRUE ~ NA_character_
  ))
examiner_race
```

Let's join the data back to the applications table.

```{r race-4}
# removing extra columns
examiner_race <- examiner_race %>% 
  select(surname,race)
app_data_sample <- app_data_sample %>% 
  left_join(examiner_race, by = c("examiner_name_last" = "surname"))
rm(examiner_race)
rm(examiner_surnames)
gc()
```


### Examiner's tenure 

To figure out the timespan for which we observe each examiner in the applications data, let's find the first and the last observed date for each examiner. We'll first get examiner IDs and application dates in a separate table, for ease of manipulation. We'll keep examiner ID (the field `examiner_id`), and earliest and latest dates for each application (`filing_date` and `appl_status_date` respectively). We'll use functions in package `lubridate` to work with date and time values.

```{r tenure-1}
library(lubridate) # to work with dates
examiner_dates <- app_data_sample %>% 
  select(examiner_id, filing_date, appl_status_date) 
examiner_dates
```

The dates look inconsistent in terms of formatting. Let's make them consistent. We'll create new variables `start_date` and `end_date`.

```{r tenure-2}
examiner_dates <- examiner_dates %>% 
  mutate(start_date = ymd(filing_date), end_date = as_date(dmy_hms(appl_status_date))) %>% 
  filter(year(end_date)<2018)
```

Let's now identify the earliest and the latest date for each examiner and calculate the difference in days, which is their tenure in the organization.

```{r tenure-3}
examiner_dates <- examiner_dates %>% 
  group_by(examiner_id) %>% 
  summarise(
    earliest_date = min(start_date, na.rm = TRUE), 
    latest_date = max(end_date, na.rm = TRUE),
    tenure_days = interval(earliest_date, latest_date) %/% days(1)
    )
examiner_dates
```

Joining back to the applications data.

```{r tenure-4}
app_data_sample <- app_data_sample %>% 
  left_join(examiner_dates, by = "examiner_id")
rm(examiner_dates)
gc()
```


## 3. Descriptive statistics

Let's look at distribution of gender, race and tenure, overall in the organization, and by technology centers (TCs) and workgroups.

### Overall distributions of gender, race and tenure.

We can we can start with simple frequencies. 

```{r sum-1}
subset_app_data <- app_data_sample %>% 
  mutate(race = as_factor(race), gender = as_factor(gender)) %>% 
  select(gender, race, tenure_days) 
subset_app_data %>% 
  count(gender) %>% 
  mutate(pct = n/sum(n))
```

```{r sum-2}
subset_app_data %>% 
  count(race) %>% 
  mutate(pct = n/sum(n))
```

We can also use library `skimr` to skim the data quickly.

```{r sum-3}
library(skimr)
subset_app_data %>%  
  skim()
```

### Plot tenure by gender and TCs

We will use `ggplot` package to plot our distributions. It's the most widely used and the most flexible plotting package. Watch a tutorial here: [https://youtu.be/h29g21z0a68](https://youtu.be/h29g21z0a68). 

First, we need to keep one observation per person, to avoid the same person contributing to the plot multiple times because they appear in the data for multiple applications.

```{r plot-gender-1, warning=FALSE}
person_level_data <- app_data_sample %>% 
  group_by(examiner_id) %>% 
  summarise(
    art_unit = min(examiner_art_unit, na.rm = TRUE),
    gender = min(gender, na.rm = TRUE),
    start_year = min(year(earliest_date), na.rm = TRUE),
    latest_date = max(latest_date, na.rm = TRUE),
    tenure_days = max(tenure_days, na.rm = TRUE)
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
    tc = floor(art_unit/100)*100,
    work_group = floor(art_unit/10)*10
  ) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(gender)) # dropping all records where we don't know the gender
person_level_data
write.csv(person_level_data, "person_level_data.csv", row.names=FALSE)
```

We start by plotting boxplots for tenure. A simple boxplot for the entire sample looks like this 

```{r plot-gender-2}
ggplot(person_level_data) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(x = tenure_days, color = gender))
```

Now let's plot gender composition by TC. Note that I am conversing the numerical variable `tc` into a factor variable, so that ggplot understands it's just a label for the Technology Center, not an actual measure of something and so intelligently adjusts the x-axis.

```{r plot-gender-3}
ggplot(person_level_data) +
  geom_bar(
    aes(x=as_factor(tc), fill = gender), 
    position = position_stack()
    ) +
  xlab("Technology Center")
```

### Tiling multiple plots

Let's plot gender composition by work group for each TC. See this page for documentation: [https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/facet_wrap.html](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/facet_wrap.html)

```{r plot-gender-4}
ggplot(person_level_data) +
  geom_bar(
    aes(x=as_factor(work_group), fill = gender), 
    position = position_stack()
    ) +
  xlab("Work group") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 1, hjust=1)) + #rotate labels
  facet_wrap(vars(tc), scales = "free")
```
